== Panopticon

App that is essentially 2 parts:
1. API End Points to report captured user behiavior
2. Interface to View Data

Currently under construction, but the goal is to be able to capture user behavior in an app and send it here. Once the data creation portion is stable, an interface for viewing that data will be next.
